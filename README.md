# Control Vector Generator

This repository contains a Python program designed to create control vectors for use with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) via analysis of hidden state activations.

See [creative-writing-control-vectors-v2.5](https://huggingface.co/jukofyork/creative-writing-control-vectors-v2.5) for latest version of the pre-generated control vectors.

See [creative-writing-control-vectors-v2.1](https://huggingface.co/jukofyork/creative-writing-control-vectors-v2.1) for older versions of the pre-generated control vectors for a wider selection of models.

## Credits

- The code in `HiddenStateDataManager` and `ModelHandler` based off Sumandora's [Removing refusals with HF Transformers](https://github.com/Sumandora/remove-refusals-with-transformers).
- The code in `ModelHandler` to save `gguf` control vectors based off Theia Vogel's [repeng](https://github.com/vgel/repeng).
- Much of the original code in `DirectionAnalyzer` was inspired by FailSpy's [abliterator](https://github.com/FailSpy/abliterator).
- The majority of the prompts in `prompts.txt` came from [Sao10K](https://huggingface.co/Sao10K)'s [Short-Storygen-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nothingiisreal/Short-Storygen-v2) dataset.

## Overview

The program operates in several steps:
1. **Data Management**: Load and manage datasets using `DatasetManager`.
2. **Hidden State Extraction**: Use `HiddenStateDataManager` to tokenize the data and extract hidden states from a pretrained model.
3. **Direction Analysis**: Analyze the hidden states to find directions that maximize discriminant ratios using `DirectionAnalyzer`.
4. **Model Modification**: Use the analyzed directions and export control vectors using `ModelHandler`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- tqdm
- gguf (for exporting control vectors)

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure all required libraries are installed:

```sh
pip install torch transformers tqdm gguf
```

**NOTE**: For very recent models, you may need to install transformers from source:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
```

## Usage

The main script can be executed from the command line with various parameters to control its behavior.

### Command Line Arguments

- `--model_id`: The model ID or path to load the pretrained model.
- `--output_path`: The path to save the control vectors.
- `--system_prompt_file`: The file path for system prompts.
- `--prompt_file`: The file path for user prompts.
- `--num_prompt_samples`: The number of prompts to sample (default: 1000).
- `--use_separate_system_message`: Flag to use separate system messages in conversation (default: False).
- `--skip_begin_layers`: The number (or fraction) of initial layers to skip (default: 0).
- `--skip_end_layers`: The number (or fraction) of end layers to skip (default: 1).
- `--discriminant_ratio_tolerance`: Tolerance used to filter low signal "noise" directions (default: 0.25).
- `--regularisation_factor`: Regularisation via "soft thresholding" mean shrinkage (default: 1.0).

### Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

```sh
python create_control_vectors.py --model_id <model_path> --output_path <output_directory> --system_prompt_file <system_prompts.json> --prompt_file <prompts.txt>
```

Replace `<model_path>`, `<output_directory>`, `<system_prompts.json>`, and `<prompts.txt>` with your specific paths and filenames.

### Output

The script will generate control vectors based on the directions analyzed. These are saved to the specified output path.

## Examples

```sh
python create_control_vectors.py --model_id ./Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 --output_path language_ --system_prompt_file data/writing_style_system_messages/language.json --prompt_file data/prompts.txt
python create_control_vectors.py --model_id ./Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 --output_path storytelling_ --system_prompt_file data/writing_style_system_messages/storytelling.json --prompt_file data/prompts.txt
python create_control_vectors.py --model_id ./Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 --output_path character_focus_ --system_prompt_file data/writing_style_system_messages/character_focus.json --prompt_file data/prompts.txt
```

These commands will generate the 3 sets of "writing style" control vectors for the `Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407` model using the provided prompts and then save the results in the current directory.

## Applying Control Vectors

### To use the default scale-factor of `1.0`:

Use the `'--control-vector'` option as follows:

```sh
llama-cli --model <model>.gguf [other CLI arguments] \
    --control-vector <model>-storytelling__descriptive.gguf \
    --control-vector <model>-character_focus__dialogue.gguf
```

For server mode:

```sh
llama-server --model <model>.gguf [other CLI arguments] \
    --control-vector <model>-storytelling__descriptive.gguf \
    --control-vector <model>-character_focus__dialogue.gguf
```

### To use custom scale-factors:

If you want finer control, use the `'--control-vector-scaled'` option like this:

```sh
llama-cli --model <model>.gguf [other CLI arguments] \
    --control-vector-scaled <model>-language__ornate.gguf 0.25 \
    --control-vector-scaled <model>-character_focus__narration.gguf 1.5
```

For server mode:

```sh
llama-server --model <model>.gguf [other CLI arguments] \
    --control-vector-scaled <model>-language__ornate.gguf 0.25 \
    --control-vector-scaled <model>-character_focus__narration.gguf 1.5
```

## Important Notes

1. **Use positive scale-factors (only)** to enhance a single side of an "axis" (e.g., "more descriptive", "more dialogue focused", etc).
2. **Do not mix both sides** of the same "axis" (e.g., `--control-vector <model>-language__simple.gguf` and `--control-vector <model>-language__ornate.gguf` will just cancel out the effect)
3. For single control vectors, the default scale-factor of `1.0` (as used by the `'--control-vector'` option) is usually sufficient.
4. You *may* need to reduce the scale factors when using multiple control vectors simultaneously.
6. Ensure your `llama.cpp` version is up to date (multi-vector support added 27/06/24 in [#8137](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/8137)).

### 2. Then we collect a large number of story prompts:

- I used [Sao10K/Short-Storygen-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Sao10K/Short-Storygen-v2) and a couple of other sources to get around 11k prompts in total.
- The [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) command is very useful for extracting the prompts only from these datasets.

### 3. Run the model on a random sample of ~1k prompts on each of the 3 classes:

- It is important that the same `'pre-prompt x prompt'` sample be used with each (```"baseline"```, ```"negative"```, ```"positive"```) triplet.
- This takes the total number of hidden-state samples I recorded to: ```3 x 5 x 1000 = 15,000``` (per layer x per model x per axis!).
- This may seem like a lot compared to what other people are using to create control vectors with, but the theory regarding [estimation of covariance matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_of_covariance_matrices) shows we need at the ***very least*** a minimum of [one sample per feature](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/90045/how-many-samples-are-needed-to-estimate-a-p-dimensional-covariance-matrix) (and the models uploaded here have between 4k and 12k hidden state dimensions!).

### 4. Create a pair of "differenced datasets" by subtracting the corresponding ```"baseline"``` class's sample from both of the other 2 classes' samples:

- The reason for this is so that we "centre" the data around the "baseline" (i.e., set the "baseline" as the origin and look for vector directions that point away from it).
- This is in contrast to assuming the difference of the means is the "centre" for a 2-class version of this using PCA on the [covariance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix) of the differences (i.e., the "standard" method of creating control vectors).

### 5. Now we take our two "differenced datasets" held in data matrices A and B (with rows as samples and columns as features):

1. Create the [cross-covariance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-covariance_matrix), `C = A^T * B`.
2. Next we [symmetrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix), `C' = (C^T + C) / 2`.
3. Perform an [eigendecomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix) on the symmetrized cross-covariance matrix `C'`.
4. Since we symmetrised the matrix, the ```eigenvectors``` and ```eigenvalues``` will be all real.
5. Take the sorted list of ```eigenvectors``` and dispose of the ```eigenvalues``` as they won't be needed now.

The reason for using the `cross-covariance matrix` instead of the `covariance matrix`:

- The `covariance matrix` of a differenced dataset exemplifies directions in **A or B** (ie: think about the expansion of `(a-b)² = a² + b² -2×a×b`).
- The `cross-covariance matrix` of a differenced dataset exemplifies directions in **A and B** (ie: akin to `a×b`, with no `a²` or `b²` terms).

The reason for creating the symmetrised matrix is two-fold:

- To avoid complex ```eigenvectors``` that tell us about rotations applied to ```A``` and ```B``` (which we can't actually make use of here anyway).
- To specifically try to find opposing/balanced "axis" for our different traits (i.e., we don't want to find positively correlated directions nor unbalanced directions).

### 6. So now we have a set of "directions" to examine:

- It turns out that 90% of the time the ```principal eigenvector``` (i.e., the ```eigenvector``` with the largest corresponding ```eigenvalue```) is the one you want.
- In the ~10% of cases where it is not the ```principal eigenvector``` or split between a couple of different ```eigenvectors```, we (greedily) create a "compound direction" by examining the [discriminant ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis) of each direction.

### 7. Finally, we project the "direction" to reorient and scale as necessary:

- There is no reason the ```eigenvectors``` point in the direction we want, so 50% of the time we have to flip all the signs by [projecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra)) our (differenced) "desired" dataset on to the (unit norm) direction and then test the sign of the mean.
- Due to the way the LLMs work via the "residual stream", the hidden states tend to get larger and larger as the layers progress, so to normalize this we also scale by the magnitude of the mean of the same projection as above.
- To better set the default scale to `1.0`, I have also performed "Soft Thresholding" on the means (ie: pulled the mean back towards zero by 1 standard-error).

**NOTES**:

- I have found the above can be applied to every layer, but often the last layer will have hidden state means that are 10-100x larger than the rest, so I have excluded these from all I have uploaded here.
- I have tried many other different eigendecompositions: PCA on the 2-class differenced datasets, PCA on the joined 2-class/3-class datasets, solving generalized eigensystems similar to CCA, and so on.
- The "balanced" directions / "axis" this method finds are the ***exact opposite*** of those needed for the [Refusal in LLMs is mediated by a single direction](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jGuXSZgv6qfdhMCuJ/refusal-in-llms-is-mediated-by-a-single-direction) paper.
